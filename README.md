# CNN - IMAGE CLASSIFICATION
This assignment embarks on leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to execute an image classification pipeline for categorizing natural scene images into distinct classes. With a dataset encompassing 25,000 150x150-pixel images distributed among six categories, including Buildings, Forest, Glacier, Mountain, Sea, and Street, the task involves training on 14,000+ images, cross-validating using 3,000+ images, and testing with 7,000+ images. We preferred CNN architecture, be it custom-built with fundamental layers or employing pre-implemented models in frameworks like Keras or PyTorch. Through this we delve into the domain of modern machine learning, exploring the robustness of CNNs in deciphering complex visual data for practical image recognition and classification purposes.

## IMPORTED DIFFERENT LIBRARIES
1. **NumPy:** Used for numerical computations and array manipulations in Python.
2. **Pandas:** Essential for data manipulation, offering data structures and operations for structured data sets.
3. **Matplotlib:** Primarily utilized for creating visualizations like plots, charts, and graphs.
4. **Seaborn:** Built on top of Matplotlib, it enhances data visualization, particularly for statistical graphics.
5. **Warnings:** Provides control over warning messages; in this case, used to ignore unnecessary warnings.
